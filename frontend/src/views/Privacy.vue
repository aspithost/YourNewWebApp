        <h2 class="h2-base"> Preferences </h2>
        <p> YourNewWebApp saves some of your preferences in the local storage of your browser. 
            These user preferences are saved for a period of up to one year. They contain no sensitive information whatsoever: 
            they are simple yes/no statements that instruct the website what to load 
            and what not to load.</p>
        <p>You can change these preferences at any time by going to the Cookie Settings page found in the footer. 
            You can't view your Cookie Settings from this page (nor from "Privacy" or "Terms"), since these pages are exempt from 
            the "Cookie Wall". From any other page on the website, you can update your Cookie Settings at any time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-base pt-4"> Cookies </h2>
        <p> This website uses cookies for a multitude of reasons, as explained below.</p>
        <h3 class="h3-base"> Stricly necessary Cookies </h3> 
        <p> YourNewWebApp uses cookies for storing actual user preferences, such as: what language you prefer the website to be in,
            some of your user credentials if you have an account, etcetera.Your login credentials are stored in separate 
            encrypted cookies to ensure their security. Account-related cookies are stored for a maximum of two weeks, and 
            other preferences for up to one year. </p>
        <h3 class="h3-base"> Statistics </h3>
        <p> This website uses cookies to monitor both performance as well as the browsing behavior of visitors. 
            This data is properly anonymized in the case of third-party scripts (Google Analytics anonymizes your IP-Address
            and the device number of your phone, or example). The reason I'd like to have this data is to see whether 
            you are a recurring user, where you're from, how much time you spend on each page etcetera. I could care less who you are, 
            which is why it's all anonymized. In compliance with European GDPR rules, the statistics cookies mentioned above 
            are essential for the functioning of yourwebwebapp.com. For more information about what Google does with your data, 
            see the <a class="text-ynwa font-bold hover:opacity-70 hover:underline" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">
            Privacy Policy of Google</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-base"> Social Media Cookies </h3>
        <p> As you may be aware, I can't show you any embedded content from the famous social media giants without them
            placing a ton of scripts and cookies on the page. These third-party scripts are far more ingenious than anything I could cook up
            as of now (who knows what the future holds, right?), so I would advise you to look up the privacy policies of these companies 
            to know what they do with your data in case you're interested. You can opt out of any or all of the embedded content 
            from these providers in the cookie settings. Please see 
        <a class="text-ynwa font-bold hover:opacity-70 hover:underline" href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">Facebook</a>'s, 
        <a class="text-ynwa font-bold hover:opacity-70 hover:underline" href="https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875" target="_blank">Instagram</a>'s and 
        <a class="text-ynwa font-bold hover:opacity-70 hover:underline" href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">Twitter</a>'s 
            privacy policies for more information.</p>
        <h3 class="h3-base"> Marketing Cookies </h3>
        <p> Currently, Your New Web App doesn't place any marketing cookies whatsoever. 
            I don't expect flocks of visitors to generate any real income anyway. 
            If that ever changes in the future, you will receive a notification and I'll update the privacy statement accordingly.</p>
