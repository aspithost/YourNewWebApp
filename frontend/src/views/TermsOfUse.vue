        <h1 class="h1-narrow"> Terms of Use </h1>
        <p>Every somewhat serious website has a Terms of Use. Seeing I've tried to build a somewhat serious website, I decided to 
            write one too. When you sign up and leave a comment, please consider the quick hitters below. </p>
        <h2 class="h3-base pt-4">Don't Do Criminal Stuff</h2>
        <p>Duh. This includes, among other things: racism, threats, trolling, linking to illegal content. 
            You know what I'm getting at. And I'll err on the side of caution on this one.</p>
        <h2 class="h3-base pt-4">Language</h2>
        <p>It's very simple. On English blogs, please post comments in (attempts at) English. On Dutch blogs, I'll allow both. Reason being:
        I assume most Dutch people have a basic enough understanding of English to post a comment in English on an English blog. I can't
        expect non-Dutchies to speak a lick of Dutch, so I'll allow English comments if they are somewhat relevant to the topic at hand.</p>
        <p>Don't be afraid to comment if you're unsure about your English. Got to start somewhere. 
        As long as you don't <b>ALL CAPS</b> your way to a comment you'll be fine.</p>
        <h2 class="h3-base pt-4">Harassment</h2>
        <p>Not much to say here really, don't be that person. Feel free to give me the business in the replies (I don't mind), 
            just be reasonable with fellow commenters.</p>
        <h2 class="h3-base pt-4">Calls to Action</h2>
        <p>Please try to stay somewhat on topic in comments. No unrelated politics or COVID discussions, you know what I'm getting at. </p>
